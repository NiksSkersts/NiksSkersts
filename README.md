My name is Niks Skersts.

Currently I am learning C# game and app development, Database [PSQL mainly] management and ASP.NET website development.
If you wanna check out my progress, you're more than welcome to check out:
- [ASP.NET website](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_one) - It's hosted on [nikssk.id.lv](https://nikssk.id.lv/) and uses Nginx on Debian 10. [Static IP got a bit too expensive. Thing got yeeted.]

For my university stuff, you can check out:
