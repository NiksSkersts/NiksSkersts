Hiya! My name is Niks Skersts.

Currently I am learning C# game and app development, Database [PSQL mainly] management and ASP.NET website development.
If you wanna check out my progress, you're more than welcome to check out:
- [ASP.NET website](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_one) - It's hosted on [nikssk.id.lv](https://nikssk.id.lv/) and uses Nginx on Debian 10. 
- [C# game development](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_two) - It's tagging along as more of an side project, but it's coming up nicely.   
- [C++ development](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_three) - Mainly for learning purposes, but it does have a potential to succeed [project_two](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_two).
- I am gonna try my hand in building LineageOS 18.1 for OnePlus 7 as another side project.

For my university stuff, you can check out:

- [Final assignment on finishing Prog. in Windows II](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/programming_final_winforms)
- [Course Work in WWW Technologies](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/raftypoile) // Side note: it's private for now, but will come public eventually. You can check project_one in the meantime, as it's built on my course work.
