Hiya! My name is Niks Skersts.

Currently I am learning C# game and app development, Database [PSQL mainly] management and ASP.NET website development.
If you wanna check out my progress, you're more than welcome to check out:
- [ASP.NET website](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_one) - It's hosted on [nikssk.id.lv](https://nikssk.id.lv/) and uses Nginx on Debian 10. 
- [C# game development](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_two) - It's tagging along as more of an side project, but it's coming up nicely.     
[WARN: This project was deprecated on 8/8/21, as I have moved most of the code to C++. For reasons stated [here](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/documentation/blob/c929d88b3af731ed699835432b94342c7df19e6f/README.md)]  
- [C++ development](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_three) - Mainly for learning purposes, but it does have a potential to succeed [project_two](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_two).
- I am gonna try my hand in building LineageOS 18.1 for OnePlus 7 as another side project.

- [Course Work in WWW Technologies](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/raftypoile) // Side note: it's private for now, but will come public eventually. You can check project_one in the meantime, as it's built on my course work.

For more related stuff, you can check out:
- [Common documentation](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/documentation) - My attempt at creating a common repo for all the common documentation.
- [Assets](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/assets) - Repo for storing self-made project assets like png, kra and possibly assets that are in use in project_one, eventually.  
Anything that isn't mine has licence and link files included in the same folder.
