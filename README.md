Hallo,
My name is Niks Skersts.

Everything below is old stuff. I am keeping it so I can laugh about myself when I look like in the picture below.

For my university stuff, you can check out:
- [C# programming task from Programming I, II and Prog. in Windows I, II](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/programming_tasks)
- [Final assignment on finishing Prog. in Windows II](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/programming_final_winforms)
- [Course Work in WWW Technologies](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/raftypoile) // Side note: it's private for now, but will come public eventually. You can check project_one in the meantime, as it's built on my course work.
- [SMNK_RASPI](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/SMNK_RASPI) Flask web app for controlling a remote car attached to Raspberry PI.
- [ASP.NET website](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_one) - It's hosted on [nikssk.id.lv](https://nikssk.id.lv/) and uses Nginx on Debian 10. [Static IP got a bit too expensive. Thing got yeeted.]

None of these are in use anywhere.
