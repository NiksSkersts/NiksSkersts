Lough

<p>People too angry,
<p>Weather too cold,
<p>Always yearning to be somewhere else,
<p>I got my wish,
<p>Found a better life, made a living,
<p>Hard work and stress in a foreign land,
<p>Abuse of alcohol, long hours and no friends,
<p>Wash, rinse and repeat,
<p>Would someone notice that I had gone missing,
<p>Stepped over my end of road,
<p>I was drunk,
<p>A step away from depths of a lough.
